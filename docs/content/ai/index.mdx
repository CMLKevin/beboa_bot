# AI Systems Overview

Beboa's AI systems work together to create a dynamic, evolving personality that remembers users and adapts to interactions.

## Architecture

<AISystemsDiagram />

<Callout type="info">
The LLM Evaluator sits at the center, processing all incoming interactions and routing them to the appropriate systems.

### Relationship Tracking

Each user has individual relationship metrics that grow over time:

| Affection | How much Beboa likes them |
| Trust | How much she trusts them |
| Familiarity | How well she knows them |
| Rivalry | Competitive energy |

<Badge variant="info">6 Stages</Badge> Stranger → Acquaintance → Regular → Friend → Close Friend → Family

## How They Work Together

<Steps>
  <Step title="Search Memories">
    User memory and server memory are searched for relevant context about the user and recent discussions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Load Relationship">
    Relationship data is loaded to understand the user's history and trust level.
  </Step>
  <Step title="LLM Evaluation">
    The LLM Evaluator analyzes the message for mood impact and interaction quality.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply Personality">
    Personality traits and current mood shape the response style and tone.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate Response">
    Response generated with full context (personality + memories + server awareness).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Post-Process">
    Memory extraction stores new information; relationship updated based on interaction quality.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Meanwhile, in the background:**
- All messages are captured for server-wide memory (non-blocking)
- Important messages (~30%) are queued for embedding
- Hourly/daily summaries extract topics and trends

## Configuration

All AI features can be configured via environment variables:

```env
# Enable/disable systems
CHAT_ENABLED=true
MEMORY_ENABLED=true
MEMORY_AUTO_EXTRACT=true
SERVER_MEMORY_ENABLED=true
TOOLS_ENABLED=true

# LLM Evaluator
LLM_EVALUATOR_ENABLED=true
LLM_EVALUATOR_MODEL=x-ai/grok-4.1-fast

# Models
OPENROUTER_MODEL=x-ai/grok-4.1-fast
EMBEDDING_MODEL=openai/text-embedding-3-small
```

See [Configuration](/getting-started/configuration) for all options.
